Final project for CMSC434 and CMSC436 Fall 2014, University of Maryland

To import into eclipse, right click in project list area, click "Import", select "git", follow the prompts to fill in the clone url from git and your username and password.

Once imported, you can use git in eclipse by right clicking on the project or file of interest and going to the "team" menu.  Main operations you'll need are "pull" to update from the online repository, "commit" to save your changes locally and "push" to submit your changes to the online repository.  Also when you add a new file you're need to right click that file and click "add".

Shouldn't need to add anything to the android SDK we got in class
